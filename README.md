# Task Maestro

**Task Maestro** is a modular task and project management tool designed to seamlessly integrate with the Orchestral AI platform. Built to prioritize functionality and interoperability, Task Maestro focuses on organizing and managing tasks programmatically while exposing polished tools for integration with LLM agents and the Orchestral AI ecosystem.

## Features

### Task Management
- **Flexible Attributes**: Manage tasks with attributes like due dates, urgency, dependencies, and repeat behaviors.
- **Built-In Inbox**: Automatically store unassigned tasks in the default "Inbox" project.
- **Task Lifecycle**: Support for task completion, deferral, and dependency tracking.
- **Serialization**: Save and load tasks and projects as JSON with readable formatting.

### Project Management
- **Organized Projects**: Group tasks into projects for hierarchical task management.
- **Inbox Default**: Unassigned tasks are automatically categorized into the "Inbox" project.
- **Project Completion**: Automatically mark projects as complete when all tasks are done.

### Integration-Ready Design
- **Natural Language Interface**: Minimal natural language commands to interact with tasks and projects.
- **Orchestral AI Integration**: Optimized for usage within the Orchestral AI ecosystem to enable advanced task orchestration and LLM-driven workflows.
- **CLI & Programmatic Access**: Manage tasks and projects directly via code or terminal commands.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python
- **Persistence**: Tasks and projects are stored as JSON files for easy inspection and manipulation.
- **Built-In Defaults**: Includes an "Inbox" project for unassigned tasks, ensuring no task is lost.
- **Extendability**: Designed to be extended with additional features like prioritization and progress tracking.

## Usage

Task Maestro is geared towards developers working with Orchestral AI and related automation platforms. Tasks and projects can be programmatically managed using the Python API:

### Example
```python
from task_maestro import DataBase, Task, Project

# Initialize the database
db = DataBase()

# Create a project
project = Project(title="New Project", description="Example project for Orchestral AI.")
db.add_project(project)

# Add a task to the project
task = Task(title="Finish documentation", due_date="2024-12-20")
db.add_task(task, project_title="New Project")

# Save changes to the database
db.save()
```

## Roadmap

- **Priority and Progress Tracking**: Add attributes for task prioritization and progress percentages.
- **Natural Language Enhancements**: Expand the capabilities of the natural language interface for more intuitive interactions.
- **Orchestral Integration Enhancements**: Include hooks for seamless synchronization with Orchestral AI workflows.
- **Custom Querying**: Advanced querying mechanisms for task and project data.
